## Overview
Project Astraeus is a new organization based in the Waterloo Region, focused on fostering an interest in engineering and entrepreneurship among youth. We aim to give students a chance to positively impact their communities while learning essential industrial skills.

## Our Vision
We strive to build a network for youth to become the next generation’s leaders in innovation through team projects aimed at fixing local issues. Our goal is to inspire changemakers through workshops, keynote lectures, and creative kit projects.

## Our Structure
### Chapters
A network of student-led chapters dedicated to researching and implementing solutions to global and local issues, such as accessibility, mental and physical health, and environmental concerns.

## Why Sponsor Us?
As high school students, we need support to provide planned opportunities. We seek donations, mentorship, speakers, components, devices, tooling, project inspirations, and logistical contributions. Your support helps catalyze necessary improvements in communities everywhere.
